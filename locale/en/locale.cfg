title=Rilys Hydrothermics

[mod-description]
description=Rilys Hydrothermics is an overhaul that aims to change the main gameplay loop of factorio, starting with Nauvis, but aspiring to alter the other planets as well, there will be a number of game stages, due to the planned eventual setting being that of rain world, those being the kinetic, steam, Electric & Bioelectric stages, and merged electric stages, with a few planned after you launch your first actual rocket but that comes later. Rather, for the hydrothermics stage of this overhaul, your goal is to launch a balloon in the steam stage to get access to the sectors which are vulcanus, fulgora, and gleba, though theyll have their names changed. You get steel on vulcanus alongside tungsten, you get electricity on fulgora, and you get bioelectricity on gleba, which all have their own uses back on nauvis and you can even make some of them on nauvis, this mod has plans to drastically modify how much other planets change how you play nauvis. Steel and electricity is obvious, however bioelectricity has shorter ranges then the extended ranges of regular electricity, BUT, buildings powered with bioelectricity within the range of the same powerpole get an efficiency bonus akin to nuclear reactors!
